Roland System-100 samples, Drum pack

This is a collection of samples that I've made using a Roland System-100,
an analog synthesizer from 1976. All sounds were sampled in 16 bit 44.1 khz,
mono directly from the synth without any modifications or effects.

All samples are free of copyright. You may use them as you like.
